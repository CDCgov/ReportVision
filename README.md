# 1. Overview
The Intelligent Data Workflow Automation (IDWA) ReportVision Project aims to support the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology (OPHDST) in enhancing the ability of state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments to manage, search, and secure critical data. As a key division of the CDC, OPHDST plays a vital role in public health infrastructure.

Please see the [UserGuide](/docs/user_guide.md) to get a technical overview of this project.

## The Problem

The exchange of public health data is hindered by outdated, manual processes. Some state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments still rely on fax, email, and physical mail to receive case data, requiring staff to manually review and re-enter information from lab reports. This labor-intensive process can take up to 20 minutes per report, and electronic data extraction remains cumbersome and error-prone, particularly when handling multiple documents. As a result, low accuracy in data ingestion impedes the ability of public health departments to efficiently process and utilize critical health data.

## The Solution

ReportVision is a powerful tool designed to automate the reading and extracting of data from lab reports, helping public health departments streamline their workflows.  Leveraging the power of the Tesseract engine and Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform, ReportVision allows teams to create customizable, data-driven templates for automatic extraction and annotation of multiple datasets—delivering notable accuracy and speed.

The goal is simple yet powerful: to provide jurisdictions with a "starter kit" that empowers them to rapidly build their own resources, provision scalable Azure infrastructure, or seamlessly replicate similar configurations in Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

With ReportVision, public health departments can move from cumbersome, error-prone processes to a highly efficient, automated workflow that supports critical decision-making with fast, reliable data.

This application offers a robust framework for public health departments and personnel to efficiently extract relevant data from lab reports utilizing an advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model.  This OCR technology significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of data extraction, taking your data processing capabilities to the next level.  

Check out the following video which demos the ReportVision application including how the updated OCR model works in action, and witness firsthand how ReportVision enhances both the speed and accuracy of data extraction!

## Future Considerations

The current version of the application is optimized only for PDF-based lab reports. However, as demand from public health departments and personnel continues to grow, we see significant potential to expand support for additional file formats in future updates.
