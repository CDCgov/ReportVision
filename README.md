# 1. Overview

The IDWA project aims to support state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments by enhancing their ability to manage, search, and secure data.  

## The Problem

Extracting data from PDFs is cumbersome and error-prone, particularly when dealing with multiple documents, resulting in low accuracy rates. This makes it difficult for public health departments to efficiently process and utilize critical data.

## The Solution

This repository focuses on developing an application that helps public health departments create data-driven templates using Microsoft Azure to consistently extract data with a higher accuracy rate. The goal is to provide jurisdictions with a "starter kit" that enables them to easily build resources from the repository, provision their own Azure infrastructure, or replicate similar configurations in Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
