# Code Review Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

The following Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are established to ensure timely and effective code reviews within the CDCgov/IDWA project:

## Response Time SLA

- **Priority**: High
- **Target Response Time**: Within 24 hours of the pull request submission
- **Description**: Reviewers commit to providing initial feedback on the pull request within 24 hours of its submission. This feedback may include identifying potential issues, requesting further clarification or asking for additional time to review.

## Review Completion SLA

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Target Completion Time**: Within 3 business days of the pull request submission
- **Description**: Reviewers commit to completing the entire review process, including addressing feedback and approving or rejecting the pull request, within 3 business days of its submission. This ensures that pull requests are processed in a timely manner and do not remain open for an extended period.

## Escalation Procedure

- **Escalation Trigger**: Review exceeds response time SLA or completion SLA
- **Escalation Contact**: @bryanbritten or @zdeveloper
- **Description**: In the event that a pull request review exceeds the defined SLAs, the submitter or reviewer may escalate the issue to the designated escalation contact. The escalation contact will investigate the delay and take appropriate actions to expedite the review process.

## Exceptions

- **Exception Criteria**: Holidays, team member unavailability, or exceptional workload
- **Description**: SLAs may be temporarily adjusted or waived in exceptional circumstances, such as during holidays, when team members are unavailable, or when the team is experiencing an exceptional workload. In such cases, affected parties will communicate the adjusted expectations and timelines accordingly.

## Regular Review of SLAs

- **Frequency**: Annually
- **Description**: SLAs will be reviewed and evaluated annually to ensure they remain relevant and effective. Feedback from team members and observations of the review process will be considered when making adjustments to the SLAs.

By adhering to these SLAs, we aim to facilitate efficient and collaborative code review processes, ultimately contributing to the overall quality and velocity of our software development efforts.
