# Code Review Guidelines

Welcome to the code review process for the CDCgov/IDWA project. Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and fostering collaboration among team members. Please consider these guidelines to ensure effective and constructive code reviews.

## Goals of Code Reviews

- Identify bugs and potential issues early in the development process.
- Ensure code adheres to project standards, best practices, and coding conventions.
- Share knowledge and encourage learning among team members.
- Improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

## Before Reviewing Code

Before starting the code review process, make sure to:

- Read the summary in full to understand the purpose and scope of the changes.
- Review any relevant documentation or design specifications linked in the summary.

## During the Review

During the code review process, keep the following in mind:

- **Be Respectful**: Use a friendly and respectful tone in your comments.
- **Focus on the Code**: Base your comments and suggestions on the code itself, not the author.
- **Be Constructive**: Provide specific feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear or seems inconsistent, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.
- **Offer Alternatives**: Instead of just pointing out problems, suggest alternative approaches or solutions.
- **Consider Readability**: Ensure the code is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
- **Check for Edge Cases**: Verify that the code handles edge cases, error conditions, and boundary scenarios.
- **Review Test Coverage**: Check if the code is adequately tested and whether new tests are needed.
- **Validate Security**: Look for potential security vulnerabilities and ensure sensitive data is handled securely.

## Providing Feedback

When providing feedback on a pull request, consider using the following templates to structure your comments:

- **Positive Feedback**: Highlight what was done well and why it's effective.
- **Constructive Criticism**: Identify areas for improvement and suggest specific changes.
- **Questions**: Seek clarification on unclear or ambiguous parts of the code.
- **Suggestions**: Offer alternative approaches or solutions to the problem.

## After the Review

After completing the code review, ensure that:

- All review comments have been addressed satisfactorily.
- The code meets the project requirements and standards.
- Tests pass successfully, and any new tests have been added.
- The changes are well-documented and explained where necessary.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your dedication to maintaining code quality through code reviews. By following these guidelines and collaborating effectively with your team members, we can continue to deliver high-quality software that meets our users' needs.

Happy reviewing!
